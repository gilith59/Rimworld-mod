# 🐛 Insect Lair Incident

Transform the Odyssey InsectLair into a dangerous random incident that spawns directly on your colony map!

## 📋 Features

### Progressive Emergence 🌋
- The ground cracks and shifts over **8-16 hours** before the cave entrance fully opens
- Visual effects and rumbling sounds warn you of the danger
- Time to move structures and prepare defenses!

### Recurring Insectoid Waves 🐛
- Insectoids emerge from the depths **every day**
- Wave strength scales with your colony's wealth (40% of threat points)
- Attacks continue until you seal the entrance

### VFE Insectoids Integration ⭐
**If VFE Insectoids 2 is installed:**
- Each incident chooses a **random geneline** (Sorne, Nuchadus, Chelis, Kemia, or Xanides)
- The cave fills with insects from that geneline ONLY
- The boss is the geneline's unique leader (Empress, Titantick, Teramantis, Gigamite, or Silverfish)!

**Without VFE Insectoids:**
- Works perfectly with vanilla insects
- HiveQueen boss fight

### Full Vanilla Cave System 🕳️
- Explore the complete Odyssey InsectLair cave
- All vanilla rewards: Gravcore, GravlitePanel, ancient crates, InsectJelly
- Boss must be defeated to unlock cave collapse

### Boss Fight 💀
- A massive boss guards the depths
- Defeat it to unlock the ability to collapse the entrance
- Stop the waves permanently!

## ⚙️ Balance

- **Earliest appearance:** Day 30 with 4+ colonists
- **Minimum interval:** 45 days between incidents
