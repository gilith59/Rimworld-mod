# 🐛 MOD UPDATE: Insect Lair Incident v2.0

Hey everyone! Major update to **Insect Lair Incident** - now with full VFE Insectoids geneline integration!

## What is it?

Transform the Odyssey InsectLair into a dangerous random incident that spawns **directly on your colony map** - like the Anomaly PitGate, but for insectoids!

## 🌟 Key Features

**Progressive Emergence** 🌋
- Ground cracks over 8-16 hours before the cave opens
- Time to prepare and move your structures!

**Recurring Waves** 🐛
- Daily insectoid attacks that scale with your wealth
- Continues until you defeat the boss and seal the entrance

**VFE Insectoids Integration** ⭐
- If you have VFE Insectoids 2 installed, each incident picks ONE random geneline
- The ENTIRE cave uses only that geneline (Sorne, Nuchadus, Chelis, Kemia, or Xanides)
- The boss is that geneline's unique leader (Empress, Titantick, Teramantis, Gigamite, Silverfish)!
- Works perfectly without VFE too (vanilla insects + HiveQueen)

**Full Cave System** 🕳️
- Explore the complete Odyssey cave
- All vanilla rewards: Gravcore, GravlitePanel, ancient crates, InsectJelly
- Boss must be defeated to unlock collapse

## 📦 Requirements

- **RimWorld 1.6** (1.5 compatible)
- **Odyssey DLC** (required)
- **VFE Insectoids 2** (optional but highly recommended!)

## 🎮 Balance

- Appears after day 30 with 4+ colonists
- 45 days minimum between incidents
- Waves every 1 day (40% of threat points)
- Safe: never spawns in fog

Huge thanks to the VFE team for the amazing insectoid genelines! This mod wouldn't be half as cool without VFE Insectoids 2.
